# Question
Whatâ€™s your favorite programming language and why?

# Answer
I thought about this question for some time and came out with a statement that I don't have a favorite language. I love to create application of any kind and language is only tool for that. But if I must I can peak top three. :)

## C++
I love about it that while using it I got full control over my applications. It force you to fully take care of memory management, to have in mind how CPU work to control the performance.

## Java
I like this language mostly by the community support with variety of tools which makes the solving of client requirements fast and pleasant.

## C#
This is language I feel most confident in since I created using it most of my production code. I prefer C# the code features over those of Java.
